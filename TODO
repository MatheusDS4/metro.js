    - [ ] Reset page roll animation in case page size conditions change
  - [ ] Support size-conditional live content pages
    - [ ] One page can target multiple sizes (e.g. support attributes like `size="< wide"` (less-than), greater-than and exact (`=` prefix optional); the page's `size` attribute will result in multiple class names like `.medium` and `.wide`)
