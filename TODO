# Live tiles

- [ ] Done
- [ ] Support background-based live tiles by creating masks (which also alter while dragging a tile), similiar to Windows Phone.
  - [ ] In that case, the container of groups should display a background that serves as the "border". That container will also contain the masks that warp to the parent's background.
  - [ ] Mask off group's remaining empty area.
