# PopoverMenu

- [x] Done
- [70%] Convert position/max-width/height to rem after transition

# ComboBox

- [x] Done
  - [ ] Fix little border-ish-jump at the end of the ComboBox open transition.

# DatePicker

- [ ] Done

# TabBar

- [ ] Done
  - [ ] Show a tag on currently checked tiles.
  - [ ] Stylize TilePage
  - [ ] Animate page roll (use a `MutationObserver` to dynamically respond to new pages being added and pages being removed)
    - [ ] Look only for pages without size condition or matching size condition
    - [ ] Look only for `.TilePage`s (ignore checked rect)
    - [ ] Reset page roll animation in case tile size changes
    - [ ] Reset page roll animation in case page size conditions change
  - [ ] Icon+label pages should be displayed like that: (note that icon may be a logo as a rectangle)
    - [ ] label = div with display=flex, flex-direction=column, justify-content=end
  - [ ] Icon+label pages = hide label in small tiles (1x1)
  - [ ] Label+icon pages use a subsubheading label. Icon should be way smaller than in icon+label tiles. They should be just "icon" tiles for small tiles (1x1).
  - [ ] Support size-conditional live content pages
    - [ ] One page can target multiple sizes (e.g. support attributes like `size="< wide"` (less-than), greater-than and exact (`=` prefix optional); the page's `size` attribute will result in multiple class names like `.medium` and `.wide`)
  - [ ] Icon size = percent inside 57x57 logical pixels.
  - [x] Optional `TilePlus` controller with `.checked()`, `.checkAll()`, `.uncheckAll()` and `.inlineGroupsAvailable()` methods
- [ ] Transparent tiles should have a drop shadow

# Page

Way contextual; skinning and behavior relies on surrounding container. It is basically used within live tiles.
